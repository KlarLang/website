# Operators

## Arithmetic

- `+ - * / %`

## Comparison

- `== != < > <= >=`

## Logical

- `and`
- `or`

`&&` and `||` do not exist in Klar. Use `and/or`.

## Precedence

Operator precedence is **not formally specified yet** (ND).

Until it is specified, write Klar as if ambiguity is a bug:
- use parentheses
- never rely on implicit precedence in complex expressions
