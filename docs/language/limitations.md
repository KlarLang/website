# Language Limitations (today)

These are current missing features:

- arrays (planned)
- structs / user-defined types
- module system (import is placeholder today)
- cross-file linking/importing symbols
- casts
- implicit numeric conversions
- switch/for/foreach

This list is not “shame”. It is a contract: Klar documents what exists.
