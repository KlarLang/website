# Contributing

Klar is experimental. Contributions are welcome, but clarity is mandatory.

This section is focused on:
- how to report issues properly
- how to write docs without lying about the state of the compiler

---

## Principles for contributors

- Prefer explicitness over convenience
- If behavior is not implemented, mark it as **NI**
- If behavior is not decided, mark it as **ND**
- Never “document the future” as if it exists today
