# Style Guide

Klar’s style is strict for clarity.

## Naming

- Use **camelCase** for variables and functions
- Prefer descriptive names over short names

## Structure

- Keep `main` small
- Extract logic into typed functions

## Control flow

- Avoid deeply nested `if` chains
- Use `otherwise ... because "..."` to document intent

## Expressions

Precedence is not formally specified (ND).  
Write with parentheses when in doubt.

## Returns

Always return explicitly.
Even `void`.
