# Docs style rules

To keep Klar docs trustworthy:

## 1) Separate "today" from "planned"
Always mark:
- **today** (implemented)
- **planned** (not implemented)
- **ND/NI** clearly

## 2) Every guide must be runnable
If a guide includes commands, they must work with:
- a clean install via Loom
- a single `.kl` file

## 3) Avoid hand-wavy wording
Bad:
- “should probably”
- “maybe works”
- “it might”

Good:
- “implemented”
- “not implemented”
- “unstable”
- “planned”

## 4) Prefer examples over paragraphs
Klar is strict. Examples reduce misinterpretation.
