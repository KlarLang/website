# Roadmap

Klar is currently pre-1.0.

## Versioning

- v0.x: unstable, breaking changes allowed
- v1.0.0: first stable line (goal)

## Priorities (planned)

1) JSON interop (first real interoperability milestone)
2) deeper semantic validation (intent/rigor validators)
3) multi-diagnostic reporting
4) additional backends/targets (later)

This roadmap is a direction, not a guarantee.
