# Author

Klar is an independent language design project created and maintained by [~K'](https://github.com/lucaas-d3v).

The project is driven by an interest in:
- language design and semantics
- explicit intent in software systems
- long-lived and polyglot architectures
- compiler pipelines and diagnostics

Klar is not backed by a company.
It is not designed to be market-driven.
Its design decisions reflect deliberate trade-offs,
not attempts at broad adoption.
