# Why Klar Exists

Klar exists because **what is ambiguous and implicit scales worse than verbosity**
in large, long-lived systems.

In small software and isolated scripts, implicit behavior appears productive.  
In large-scale systems, it turns into **silent errors, hard-to-trace bugs,
and structurally fragile behavior**.

Klar exists to **treat ambiguity as a design error** and to enable the construction
of **polyglot systems in a stable, predictable, and precise way**.

## What Klar Refuses to Do

Klar refuses to:

- infer or guess the developer’s intent  
- allow implicit or semantically ambiguous behavior  
- accept more than one interpretation for the same construct  
- hide boundaries between languages, types, or contexts  

If something matters, **it must be explicitly declared**.  
The language must not guess.

## What Klar Considers a Language Failure

Klar considers a language failure **any behavior that depends on implicit
assumptions made by the developer or by the machine**.
