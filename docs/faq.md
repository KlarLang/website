# FAQ

## Is Klar stable?
No. Before v1.0.0, breaking changes are expected.

## Why is Klar so strict?
Because Klar optimizes for reliability and clarity, not convenience.

## Why is `@Use("java")` required everywhere?
By design. Klar prefers explicitness over convention.

## Does Klar support Rust backend today?
No. Only `java` is supported today. Rust is a long-term direction.

Not yet.
